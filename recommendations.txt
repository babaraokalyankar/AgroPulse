None:
Your crop appears healthy. Use balanced organic fertilizers like compost or well-rotted manure.
Maintain consistent irrigation using drip or sprinkler methods.
Regularly test soil for nutrients and pH balance.
Apply biofertilizers like Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria to boost growth.

Mild:
Monitor the crop closely for early symptoms.
Apply neem oil spray every 7 days as a natural preventive.
Use biofertilizers and compost to strengthen crop immunity.
Improve soil aeration and avoid overwatering.

Moderate:
Apply mild fungicides like Mancozeb (2g/l) or Copper Oxychloride.
Remove visibly infected plants and leaves.
Enhance field drainage and reduce moisture stagnation.
Maintain crop spacing and avoid overhead irrigation.

Severe:
Immediate intervention required. Use a broad-spectrum fungicide or bactericide.
Remove and destroy heavily infected plants.
Disinfect farm tools and avoid working in wet fields to prevent spread.
Apply Trichoderma or Pseudomonas bio-control agents in soil.
Rotate crop with non-host varieties for next season.

Bacterial Wilt:
Apply Streptocycline 100 ppm solution during early infection stages.
Avoid waterlogging and use raised beds to improve drainage.
Ensure field sanitation and remove infected plants.
Adopt crop rotation with non-host crops like cereals.

Leaf Spot:
Spray Mancozeb 2g/liter every 10 days until symptoms reduce.
Improve air circulation between plants.
Remove infected leaves and avoid overhead irrigation.
Apply neem oil as a natural preventive measure.

Rhizome Rot:
Use Trichoderma viride mixed with compost during planting.
Avoid excess moisture—improve drainage and avoid late irrigation.
Treat seed rhizomes with fungicide before sowing.
Monitor regularly for early signs and remove infected rhizomes.

Powdery Mildew:
Spray Sulphur-based fungicides like Wettable Sulphur at 2g/liter.
Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer—use balanced nutrients.
Improve plant spacing for better airflow.
Apply organic compost to enhance plant immunity.
